# VeloUtils

Adds a variety of small but useful functions to Velocity.

> [!NOTE]
>
> By default, all functions are disabled. Please edit the `config.yml` file to enable the functions.

## Current Features

- Whitelist function for sub-servers
- Server Links (List of custom URLs that servers can show in player pause menus, available on 1.21 and above clients)

## Getting Started

1. Place the JAR file in the `/plugins` folder of your Velocity server.
2. Start up the Velocity server.
3. Grant operators the `veloutils.admin` permission.
4. Edit the `/plugins/veloutils/config.yml` file to enable/disable/configure features.
5. If you enable or disable a feature, you will need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.
6. Use the `/veloutils reload` command to reload the configuration.
